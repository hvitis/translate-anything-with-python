# Translate books with Google Translate for free to any language with Python ðŸ“š

Here you have the bear minimum if you know Python. Tutorial with additional information about the process, copyrights and lawful bindings for translations can be found [on my blog][5].

The following code generates 2 docx files of text scanned from photos.
Photos have to be located within a folder placed next to this script. The flow of work is:

- OCR scanning all photos with [pytesseract][8]
- Using pure [requests][7] to translate via Google API (__not__ using _google-cloud-translate_)
- Using [python-docx][6] to generate docx documents for original and translated books.

In order to make it work a few steps have to be fulfilled:

1. Install __requirements.txt__ by running 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. [Google Service Account Credentials][0] have to be generated.
3. [Google SDK package][1] installed.
4. [Credentials][2] loaded into terminal
```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path-to-credentials/credentials.json"
```
5. Terminal [authenticated][10]

```
gcloud auth login
```

Then we need to [get auth token][3] obtained from command line. In order to do that run:
```
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token
```

You should recieve something like:
```
ya29.c.Kp8BAQhYC2hyHsFuRlpjrJnT0XkT[...]axi0Z_3y1-xdUaodmnnjkmlquF3ol8CInVDYPdJO8jMr3h-alcQUayKAJD_e7cuw
```

Using this token update **GOOGLE_API_TOKEN** variable in **main.py** and run it.

```
python3 main.py
```

You will be prompted for folder name, you can type _herman_hesse_ which is a name of example folder that comes with this repo.

```
> python3 main.py
Enter name of the folder with images of scanned book: herman_hesse
```

You can run the script within a folder with multiple books to translate. For example:

    â”œâ”€â”€ herman_hesse/             # Folder with pictures of pages from example book
    â”œâ”€â”€ another_book/            # Folder with pictures of pages from another book
    â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                   
    â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
    â””â”€â”€ README.md

## Results

Two docx documents opened next to each other:
