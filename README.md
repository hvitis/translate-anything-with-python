# Translate anything with Google Translate using Python ðŸ“š

Benefits:

- Only a couple of code lines
- Free

Here you have the bear minimum if you know Python. Tutorial with additional information about the process, copyrights and lawful bindings for translations can be found [on my blog][5].
## Results

Two docx documents opened next to each other:

![Siddhartha](./translation_result.png 'translation_result')

## Instruction

The following code generates 2 docx files of text scanned from photos. It may also generate translation from .docx file using Google Cloud API (It's free for the first 3 months). If you want to translate more documents or in a specific way, try using Google Document Translation API - it will be quicker.

On initializing you choose whether you want to translate a folder with pictures or a single document file.

If you select the photos, then they need to be located within a folder placed next to translate module (folder). The flow of work is:

- OCR scanning all photos with [pytesseract][8]
- Using pure [requests][7] to translate via Google API (__not__ using _google-cloud-translate_)
- Using [python-docx][6] to generate docx documents for original and translated books.

In order to make it work a few steps have to be fulfilled:

1. Install __requirements.txt__ by running 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. [Google Service Account Credentials][0] have to be generated.
3. [Google SDK package][1] installed.
4. [Credentials][2] loaded into terminal
```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path-to-credentials/credentials.json"
```
5. Terminal [authenticated][10]

```
gcloud auth login
```

Then we need to [get auth token][3] obtained from command line. In order to do that run:
```
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token
```

You should recieve something like:
```
ya29.c.Kp8BAQhYC2hyHsFuRlpjrJnT0XkT[...]axi0Z_3y1-xdUaodmnnjkmlquF3ol8CInVDYPdJO8jMr3h-alcQUayKAJD_e7cuw...........
```

Using this token update **GOOGLE_API_TOKEN** variable in **main.py** and run it.

TODO: using .env file to load variables

```
python3 translate
```

You will be prompted for folder name, you can type _herman_hesse_ which is a name of example folder that comes with this repo.

```
> python3 translate
Enter name of the folder with images of scanned book: herman_hesse
```

You can run the script within a folder with multiple books to translate. For example:

    â”œâ”€â”€ herman_hesse/             # Folder with pictures of pages from example book
    â”œâ”€â”€ another_book/            # Folder with pictures of pages from another book
    â”œâ”€â”€ translate / __init__.py  
    â”œâ”€â”€ translate / __main__.py  
    â”œâ”€â”€ translate / languages.py                   
    â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
    â””â”€â”€ README.md

## Remember

Books are protected with copyrights! Translate only books that are on the public domain. If you want to thank me and/or know more, visit [blog post for this code][5].
